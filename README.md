# Android Hidden APIs

**Android Hidden APIs** are classes, methods and resources that Google hides from you because of stability reason.
These features are hidden because they may be changed on next API version.

The internal APIs are located in package `com.android.internal` and available in the `framework.jar`,
while the hidden APIs are located in the `android.jar` file with `@hide` javadoc attribute.
Now you know the difference. But I will refer to both as hidden APIs.

This repo contains custom `android.jar` which you can use to develop your app.
However, if you urgently need to create your own `android.jar`, I also share you the Krabby Patty
secret recipe here: [Create Your Own Android Hidden APIs](https://medium.com/@hardiannicko/create-your-own-android-hidden-apis-fa3cca02d345).

## Use Custom `android.jar`

1. Download custom `android.jar` from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/17oMwQ0xBcSGn159mgbqxcXXEcneUmnph).
2. Go to `<SDK location>/platforms/`.
3. Copy, paste and replace the downloaded hidden API file into this directory, e.g. `android-30/android.jar`.
4. Change `compileSdkVersion` and `targetSdkVersion` to 35 (for example).
5. Finally, rebuild your project.

Note: Higher `compileSdkVersion` and `targetSdkVersion` will be better.

## Resources Helper
![Maven Central](https://img.shields.io/maven-central/v/com.anggrayudi/android-hidden-api.svg)

If you plan to use only Android internal resources rather than internal classes or methods, do:

````gradle
dependencies {
    implementation 'com.anggrayudi:android-hidden-api:X.Y'
}
````

Where `X.Y` is the library version: ![Maven Central](https://img.shields.io/maven-central/v/com.anggrayudi/android-hidden-api.svg)

All versions can be found [here](https://oss.sonatype.org/#nexus-search;gav~com.anggrayudi~android-hidden-api~~~~kw,versionexpand).
To use `SNAPSHOT` version, you need to add this URL to the root Gradle:

```groovy
allprojects {
    repositories {
        google()
        mavenCentral()
        // add this line
        maven { url "https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots" }
    }
}
```

Here's some example of accessing internal resources:

```java
String accept = InternalAccessor.getString("accept");
float sbar_height = InternalAccessor.getDimension("status_bar_height");
int notif_color = InternalAccessor.getColor("config_defaultNotificationColor");
```

## Contributing

If you have your own custom `android.jar` and want to add it to
[Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/17oMwQ0xBcSGn159mgbqxcXXEcneUmnph),
please create an issue. I will upload it.
